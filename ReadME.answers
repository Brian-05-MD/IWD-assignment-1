(a.)Elements i found most challenging were the table,links,table,navigation structure, and background settings.                                                                                                       The table: was challenging because i had to remember the correct orders of tags eg,<tr> and <td>.              The image element: at first it was difficult because the image was not displaying due to file path and naming issues.                                                                                                         The navigation menu: it required careful arrangement to make sure all links worked properly.                   The link element: it was confusing when creating navigations between setions.                                  The background settings: it was tricky because i had to use the correct command inside the body tags.         All these mistakes where overcomed through practice and correcting small errors.                                (b.)the semantic elements use were;                                                                            The header: which contained the company name and slogan.                                                       The footer: contained the copyright information                                                                Each section: represented a part of the website, such as home,About, Service, and Contact.                     (c.)The most useful element was the table which organized my layout,it created navigation menu and arrange some of the content,especially since i was using only HTML without CSS.

Three most important attributes i used were:                                                                   href-used in links to navigate between sections.                                                               src-used to display images.                                                                                    bgcolor-used to set the background color of the page.                                                          (b.) The id attributes is for one unique section whic is used to identify specific sections of the page. Where as class attributes is for multiple elements with the same type, which is used to style multiple elements in the same way.

(a.)I planned the webisite before coding by deciding on the main sections:                                         Home                                                                                                           About Us                                                                                                       Service                                                                                                        Contact                                                                                                    (b.) My approach was simple: I saved the file,opened it in the browser,checked if everything appeared correctly and fixed any errors in the code.                                                                     (c.) The main challenges were;images not displaying,remembering correct HTMl tags and aliging content properly.                                                                                                       I overcomed these by: Checking file names and paths,reviewing examples and testing the page repeatedly until it worked.
